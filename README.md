# Robotframework-python

This repository is dedicated to exploring and documenting the use of [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/). Is a generic, open-source automation framework primarily used for test automation and robotic process automation (RPA). It's known for its keyword-driven approach, making it easier to create and maintain test cases and automate tasks, even for those with limited programming experience.

If you have any feedback on this project and want me to add or update any part, let me know with a [new issue](https://github.com/Ian-Ruiz-DEV/Robotframework-python/issues). Use the bug or task template and fill in the requested information, I will work on it as soon as possible!

Best regards and thanks for reading!
